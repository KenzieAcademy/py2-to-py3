# py2-to-py3
`py2-to-py3` is intended as practice for transforming Python2 code into Python3 code.

## Setup

1.  Be sure to [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) this respository!


2.  Clone the forked repository onto your machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<github_username>/py2-to-py3
    ```
3.  `cd` into the repository.
    ```bash
    cd py2-to-py3
    ```
4.  Use [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) to create the virtual environment and install the dependencies.
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
## Your Task

Convert the code, so that when you run the tests, all tests are passing.

You can also run it directly from your terminal
```bash
python main.py
```
## Testing
Run `pytest` in your terminal
```bash
pytest
```
*Note:* pytest is included in pyproject.toml. It should install automatically when you run `poetry install`
